    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "`qiskit-ibmq-provider` was the original implementation of the `Provider` interface in `qiskit-terra` and the main entry point for accessing IBM Quantum’s systems, simulators, and services. As IBM Quantum expanded, different disjoint services were added to `qiskit-ibmq-provider`, often causing confusion among users, and making new features difficult to find. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of [Qiskit Runtime](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab/docs/iql/runtime/), we decided it was time to restructure the provider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The access to backend services (most of the submodules in the previous `qiskit.providers.ibmq`), is replaced by this [qiskit-ibm-provider](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-ibm-provider/) package. It has a similar interface as the original `qiskit-ibmq-provider` (with `ibm-` instead of `ibmq-`) and gives direct access to the [IBM Quantum compute resources](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/services/resources). If you need lower-level access to do experiments like device characterization or to research new error correction routines, `qiskit-ibm-provider` is more suitable for you. \n",
    "- The access to Qiskit Runtime service (formally in `qiskit.providers.ibmq.runtime`), goes into [qiskit-ibm-runtime](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-ibm-runtime/). It provides access to managed services through the Qiskit Runtime primitives which are integrated with the latest quantum computing technologies, such as error  mitigation and correction. If you prefer getting high quality probability distribution or expectation values without having to optimize the circuits yourself, you may want to start here. \n",
    "- The access to the experiment service (formally in `qiskit.providers.ibmq.experiment`) goes into [qiskit-ibm-experiment](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-ibm-experiment/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This migration guide focuses on moving from `qiskit-ibmq-provider` to `qiskit-ibm-provider`. For the rest of the migration guides, check https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider#migration%20guides "
